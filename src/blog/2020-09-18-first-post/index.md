Hi! This is my first blog post on how I added a blog to my portfolio site. 
I am currently a Lambda School student in their "Full Stack Web" course.
This site is using Gatsby and we used React to learn "front end" stuff so 
it seemed like a natural choice. I didn't have a blog in mind when I got my site
up and running so I didn't use a "blog starter"(https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?v=2). I did however use Gatsby's default starter. I could not have added a blog to my site without egghead.io's (https://egghead.io/) "Build a Blog with React and Markdown using Gatsby" by Taylor Bell. I had to rewatch stuff because there was Gatsby specific things I didn't know like GraphQL and overall putting stuff together.
