I don't know about you but for me making "navs" has been/is a frustrating experience. A "nav" if you didn't already know is how you navigate a website and is 
typically or should be intuitive in helping you get around the site. I feel it should be a straightforward process but for me it is not. The way I think about it is you 
should be able to have an [HTML skeleton](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/), insert "nav", "ul", and "li" tags and tada!
This process of making a "nav" may be more about getting better at CSS/design but I digress. SO. I'm writing this
in part to showcase my process of making a "nav" and share my experience and hopefully together be able to understand some basic
core HTML/CSS skills and end up with a nav. I'm shooting to be able to make a navigation much like [Chipotle's](https://www.chipotle.com/) for my 
[mom's place](https://www.orderoliviascafe.com/) (still in my imagination phase).
