I don't know about you but for me making "navs" has been/is a frustrating experience. A "nav" if you didn't already know is how you navigate a website and is 
typically or should be intuitive in helping you get around the site. I feel it should be a straightforward process but for me it is not. The way I think about it is you 
should be able to have an [HTML skeleton](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/), insert "nav", "ul", and "li" tags and tada!
This process of making a "nav" may be more about getting better at CSS/design but I digress. SO. I'm writing this
in part to showcase my process of making a "nav" and share my experience and hopefully together be able to understand some basic
core HTML/CSS skills and end up with a nav. We'll try our best to clone [Chipotle's](https://www.chipotle.com/) nav for my 
[mom's place](https://www.orderoliviascafe.com/) (still in my imagination phase). Ok. Lets do this.

1.) Have HTML skeleton aka template linked right above. I'll use an even simpler one for demonstrative purposes. Also, don't worry
about anything except a simple [html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp) file(can use simple text editor like Notepad) you could open in a browser.

```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>"navs suck"</title>
    </head>

    <body>
    <!-- nav here -->
    </body>
    </html>
```
